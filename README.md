### Issues and Resolutions to issues found during testing

* Coaches Photos  loading issue on Coaches Page, this was fixed by storing the photos on Cloudinary.com and linking them to the project.

# Deployment of Project
    
   * Project Creation
    
The project is using the code institute template [template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) by clicking 'Use this template'. Under the Repository name, I input Irisbodybuilding and checked the Include all branches checkbox. 
I then navigated to the new [repository](https://github.com/fitabigail/irishbodybuilding). Open the Gitpod from Github my repository and open a new workspace. On Gitpod I typed all my code.

The following commands were used throughout the project:

+ git add filename - This command was used to add files to the staging area before committing.
+ git commit -m *commit message explaining the updates* - This command was used to commit changes to the local repository.
+ git push - This command is used to push all committed changes to the GitHub repository. 


* Deployment was made possible by GitHub

    + Initiated a repository in git:  https://fitabigail.github.io/irishbodybuilding/
    + Created all folders and files and code project
    + Go to the GitHub website
    + Go to my repository on the GitHub
    + Go to the Settings tab and click on
    + Go to GitHub Page and link the main root to Master Branch 
    + Once this is done the page will automatically create the ribbon with the HTTP host page name that is been hosted by GitHub.
